# Project Scratchpad

## Background and Motivation
We need to implement a voice dictation feature that allows doctors to record their medical consultation notes verbally. The system should:
1. Record the doctor's voice
2. Transcribe it using Whisper API
3. Analyze the transcription with GPT-4 to structure it into specific medical fields
4. Auto-fill the consultation form with the results

## Key Challenges and Analysis
1. Audio Recording & Format
   - Need to handle browser microphone access
   - Must use supported audio formats (webm, mp4, wav, ogg)
   - Need to handle recording errors gracefully

2. API Integration
   - Two-step process: Whisper for transcription, then GPT-4 for analysis
   - Need to ensure proper French language support
   - Need to structure medical information correctly

3. User Experience
   - Clear recording status indicators
   - Progress feedback during processing
   - Error handling and user notifications

## High-level Task Breakdown

1. Voice Recording Setup
   - [x] Implement MediaRecorder with proper format detection
   - [x] Add recording start/stop functionality
   - [x] Handle recording errors and permissions
   - Success Criteria:
     * Successfully records audio in supported format
     * Shows clear recording status to user
     * Handles permissions and errors gracefully

2. OpenAI Integration
   - [ ] Set up OpenAI API key in environment
   - [ ] Implement Whisper API call for transcription
   - [ ] Implement GPT-4 analysis with medical prompt
   - Success Criteria:
     * Successfully transcribes French audio
     * GPT-4 correctly structures medical information
     * All API errors are handled properly

3. Form Integration
   - [x] Structure GPT-4 output to match form fields
   - [x] Implement form auto-fill functionality
   - [x] Add success/error notifications
   - Success Criteria:
     * Form fields are correctly populated
     * User gets clear feedback on process status

## Project Status Board
Current Task: OpenAI Integration
- [x] Basic recording functionality
- [ ] OpenAI API key setup
- [ ] Whisper transcription
- [ ] GPT-4 analysis
- [x] Form auto-fill

## Current Status / Progress Tracking
- Voice recording functionality is implemented
- Form structure is ready
- Need to implement OpenAI integration
- Next immediate step: Set up OpenAI API key

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests
*Waiting for OpenAI API key to proceed with implementation*

## Lessons
- Audio format compatibility varies by browser - need format detection
- GPT-4 prompt needs to be specific for medical field structuring
- Always handle microphone permissions gracefully
